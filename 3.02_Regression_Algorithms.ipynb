These categories are:\n","\n","1. Batch Gradient Descent (BGD)\n","2. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) \n","3. Mini-Batch Gradient Descent (Mini BGD)\n","\n","\n","#### **1. Batch Gradient Descent (BGD):**\n","\n","- Batch gradient descent (BGD), also known as vanilla gradient descent, measures the error for each example in the training dataset, but the model is updated only after all of the training examples have been evaluated.\n","\n","- This whole process is referred to as a training epoch because it resembles a loop.\n","\n","- For each gradient descent iteration, it processes all the training samples. However, batch gradient descent is computationally very expensive when the number of training examples is high.\n","\n","- Thus, if the number of training examples is high, we tend to use stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or mini-batch gradient descent (Mini BGD) instead.\n","\n","#### **2. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):**\n","\n","- Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a form of gradient descent that processes one training example per iteration.\n","\n","- It estimates the error for each example in the training dataset and updates the parameters one by one.\n","\n","- Based on the problem statement, batch gradient descent (BGD) can be much faster because the parameters are modified even after an iteration in which only a single example has been processed.\n","\n","- One advantage is that the frequent updates allow us to track our progress in great detail.\n","\n","- However, even if the number of training examples is high, it can only process one of them, which will add to the system's overhead and the number of iterations needed.\n","\n","#### **3. Mini-Batch Gradient Descent (Mini BGD):**\n","\n","- Mini-batch gradient descent (Mini BGD) combines the principles of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and batch gradient descent (BGD) and is faster than both.\n","\n","- It divides the training dataset into small batches and updates each of those batches. This establishes a balance between the robustness of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and the efficiency of batch gradient descent (BGD).\n","\n","- It is compatible with both larger and smaller
